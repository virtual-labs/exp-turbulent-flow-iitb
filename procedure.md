   <li>
      Enter the Hot and Cold fluid inlet and outlet temperatures along with the volumetric flowrate in the Table displayed on the screen.
   </li><br>
   <li>
      The other sets of readings will be displayed automatically.
   </li><br>
   <li>
      The table with the fluid properties will be displayed on the screen along with the areas and equivalent diameter calculated earlier. Also, a table with the temperatures and time along with the various entities to be calculated will be displayed.
   </li><br>
   <li>
      The various entities namely, v, u, m, Q, LMTD and U have to be calculated. The formulae for the same shall be visible by moving the cursor on the headings of the respective columns.
   </li><br>
   <li>
      After entering the calculated value, click on the VERIFY Tab. If the value is correct, proceed for the next calculation, else a message ‘THE VALUE IS WRONG’ will appear.
   </li><br>
   <li>
      Click on NEXT for the next screen to appear.
   </li><br>
   <li>
      Additional quantities need to be calculated and entered in the table displayed. The formulae for the same shall be visible by moving the cursor on the headings of the respective rows. After each calculation click on the CAL Tab. If the value is correct, proceed for the next calculation, else a message RECALCULATE will appear.

      Click on NEXT for the next screen to appear.
   </li><br>
   <li>
      Two additional tables for calculating Prandtl number, Reynold’s number along with heat transfer coefficients will be displayed. The formulae for the same will be visible by moving the cursor on the respective headings. After each calculation click on the CAL Tab. If the value is correct, proceed for the next calculation, else a message ‘THE VALUE IS WRONG’ will appear.
   </li><br>
   <li>
      A CAUTION or ERROR message may be displayed if the value of Reynold’s number is less than the turbulent flow range.
